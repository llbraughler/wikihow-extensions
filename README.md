# wikihow-extensions
This is a collection of MediaWiki extensions I have developed during my tenure at wikiHow. Note: Most of these are not runnable on their own and are dependent on some other wikiHow features. You're welcome to use the code to make 
other things, though. Licensed under GNU GPL v2.
